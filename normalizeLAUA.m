function [LAnormalized,UAnormalized]=normalizeLAUA(LA,UA,datafile,TimeStampMatrix)
%
% Usage: [LAnorm,UAnorm]=normalizeLAUA(LA,UA)
%
% This function normalizes the upper and lower asymptotes 
% for the Process S model and normalizes them to the mean SWS delta 
% power in last 4 hours of the baseline light period (1-5PM)
%
% INPUTS: 
% LA:       scalar (SWA) or vector (lactate) of the lower asymptote
% UA:       scalar (SWA) or vector (lactate) of the upper asymptote
% TimeStampMatrix:  A matrix with as many columns as epochs. Each column
%                   contains a string with the month,day,year,hour,minute,second
